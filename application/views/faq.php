		We're also working on a way to allow you to add your favorite restaurants.

	    <h2>Q: Who can see my uploads?</h2>
	    <ul>
		<li>The short answer is: anyone who looks for it. Your DishClips are uploaded and stored in that restaurant's profile. So 
		other foodies like you who visit that restaurant's profile get to see your DishClips. But the best way to get people to take a look at your
		DishClips is to share them on Facebook and Twitter so your friends can see your handy work.
			</li>
		</ul>       
	
	    <h2>Q: Why did my upload fail?</h2>
	    <ul>
		<li>Well videos can get pretty large and if you're not near a good WiFi point or don't have good reception you might see some issues. We're working on all kinds of way to optimize your experience. This is one of the reasons we're only giving you 17 seconds to do your business right now.
